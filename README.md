Sound Reactive Led Strip by the use of Arduino

Light up your new year parties and impress all your friends with these amazing music-reactive multicolor LED lights that respond and change their colors on every loud beat. These lights are nothing but simple RGB LED strips connected to Arduino - the brain of this project. LED strips mean that you can mount them anywhere in your home and even outdoors. The main purpose of this project was to use it at parties, but you can also use it for daily purposes for making your music more interesting! Whether you mount it on your entrance door, around your sofa, LED TV, computer desk, or walls, that's up to you. The uses of this thing are endless! The only condition is to have an audio output device near your lights to feed them with audio signals that can be processed and reacted upon.
Based on this idea, I tried to make a cheap sound-reactive  led strip.
